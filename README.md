Brief:

The project is a forum based app for the NFL's fantasy football game, user's can make different types of posts and comment on posts made by other users. They can also view other users profile pages and from their see posts that user has contributed too which they can then also navigate too.

Amazon Web Services
Facebook oAuth
NFL Fantasy API

Challenges:

Implementing Facebook oAuth to the app was the most difficult part of the project and took the combination of previous work, lesson notes and the documentation provided by Facebook to make it work correctly. Another challenge was when a user deletes their profile, as this affected the site where content they had provided in posts and comments would no longer display correctly, as the user they were attributed too was no longer in the database. 

Conclusion: 

I have enjoyed the project very much and feel I have learnt alot from it, improvements I would like to make is to allow the user to get more stats on stats index, but unfortunately due to the API used being out of season, much of the data is not curretly available. I'd also like to make improvements to over all styling, and also show in the comments page the time and date a comment was created.
